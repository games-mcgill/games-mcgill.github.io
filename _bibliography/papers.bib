   abstract = {Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 50%, making it one of the most lethal gynecological cancers for women in the developed world today. Delayed presentation of clinical symptoms and late-stage diagnosis drive the high mortality rate of this disease. Early detection is associated with significant improvements in survival, however, screening in the general population is currently not recommended at this time due to a notable lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early-stage disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the current landscape of ovarian cancer diagnostics, emphasizing emerging methodologies for the non-invasive detection of HGSC.},

   abstract = {Serological tests play an important role in the fight against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including monitoring the dynamic immune response after vaccination, identifying past infection and determining community infection rate. Conventional methods for serological testing, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and chemiluminescence immunoassays, provide reliable and sensitive antibody detection but require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and/or lengthy assay time. Conversely, lateral flow immunoassays are suitable for rapid point-of-care tests but have limited sensitivity. Here, we describe the development of a rapid and sensitive magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform that can address the current gap in point-of-care serological testing for COVID-19. Our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform automates a magnetic bead-based, single-binding, and one-wash immuno-PCR assay in a palm-sized magnetofluidic device and delivers results in ∼30 min. In the device, a programmable magnetic arm attracts and transports magnetically-captured antibodies through assay reagents pre-loaded in a companion plastic cartridge, and a miniaturized thermocycler and a fluorescence detector perform immuno-PCR to detect the antibodies. We evaluated our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR with 108 clinical serum/plasma samples and achieved 93.8% (45/48) sensitivity and 98.3% (59/60) specificity, demonstrating its potential as a rapid and sensitive point-of-care serological test for COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Variation in methylcytosine is perhaps the most well-studied epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation. Methods that have been developed and implemented for assessing DNA methylation require sample DNA to be extracted, purified and chemically-processed through bisulfite conversion before downstream analysis. While some automated solutions exist for each of these individual process steps, a fully integrated solution for accomplishing the entire process in a high-throughput manner has yet to be demonstrated. Thus, sample processing methods still require numerous manual steps that may reduce sample throughput and precision, while increasing the risk of contamination and human error. In this work, we present an integrated, automated solution for performing the entire sample preparation process, including DNA extraction, purification, bisulfite conversion and PCR plate preparation within in an enclosed environment. The method employs silica-coated magnetic particles that eliminate the need for a centrifuge or vacuum manifold, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of the required automation platform. Toward this end, we also compare commercial DNA extraction and bisulfite conversion kits to identify a protocol suitable for automation to significantly improve genomic and bisulfite-treated DNA yields over manufacturer protocols. Overall, this research demonstrated development of an automated protocol that offers the ability to generate high-quality, bisulfite-treated DNA samples in a high-throughput and clean environment with minimal user intervention and comparable yields to manual processing.},

   abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is by far the most commonly used method of nucleic acid amplification and has likewise been employed for a plethora of diagnostic purposes. Nonetheless, multiplexed PCR-based detection schemes have hitherto been largely limited by technical challenges associated with nonspecific interactions and other limitations inherent to traditional fluorescence-based assays. Here, we describe a novel strategy for multiplexed PCR-based analysis called Ligation-eNabled fluorescence-Coding PCR (LiNC PCR) that exponentially enhances the multiplexing capability of standard fluorescence-based PCR assays. The technique relies upon a simple, preliminary ligation reaction in which target DNA sequences are converted to PCR template molecules with distinct endpoint fluorescence signatures. Universal TaqMan probes are used to create target-specific multicolor fluorescence signals that can be readily decoded to identify amplified targets of interest. We demonstrate the LiNC PCR technique by implementing a two-color-based assay for detection of 10 ovarian cancer epigenetic biomarkers at analytical sensitivities as low as 60 template molecules with no detectable target cross-talk. Overall, LiNC PCR provides a simple and inexpensive method for achieving high-dimensional multiplexing that can be implemented in manifold molecular diagnostic applications.},

   abstract = {Abstract Adenomyosis and peritoneal endometriosis are common gynecologic lesions; they are characterized by aberrant locations of normal-appearing endometrium in myometrium and peritoneal surface, respectively. Both ectopic lesions are speculated to originate from uterine eutopic endometrium, which is composed of epithelium and stroma, but how these two different tissue types co-evolve in ectopic locations remains unclear. Here, we analyzed exome-wide mutations and global methylation in microdissected epithelium and stroma separately in paired adenomyosis, peritoneal endometriosis, and endometrium to investigate their relationship. Analyses of somatic mutations and their allele frequencies indicate monoclonal development not only in epithelium but also in the stroma of adenomyosis and peritoneal endometriosis. Our preliminary phylogenetic study suggests a plausible clonal derivation in epithelium and stroma of both ectopic and eutopic endometrium from the same founder epithelium-stroma progenitor cells. While a patient-specific methylation landscape is evident, adenomyosis epithelium and stroma can be distinguished from normal-appearing eutopic endometrium epigenetically. In summary, endometrial stroma, like its epithelial counterpart, could be clonal and both ectopic and eutopic endometrium following divergent evolutionary trajectories. Our data also warrant future investigations into the role of endometrial stroma in the pathobiology of endometrium-related disorders. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

   abstract = {Abstract We previously reported CHFR methylation in a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC; ∼30%) with high concordance with microsatellite instability (MSI). We also showed that CHFR methylation predicted for sensitivity to docetaxel, whereas the MSI-high phenotypes were sensitive to gemcitabine. We hypothesized that this subset of patients with CRC would be selectively sensitive to gemcitabine and docetaxel. We enrolled a Phase 2 trial of gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with MSI-high and/or CHFR methylated CRC. The primary objective was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 response rate. Enrolled patients were treated with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 8 of each 21-day cycle. A total of 6 patients with CHFR-methylated, MSI-high CRC were enrolled from September 2012 to August 2016. The study was closed in September of 2017 due to poor accrual prior to reaching the first interim assessment of response rate, which would have occurred at 10 patients. No RECIST criteria tumor responses were observed, with 3 patients (50%) having stable disease as best response, 1 lasting more than 9 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.79 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28, not available [NA]) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.67 months (95% CI = 4.24, NA). Common grade 3 toxicities were lymphopenia (67%), leukopenia (33%), and anemia (33%). Although negative, this study establishes a proof-of-concept for the implementation of epigenetic biomarkers (CHFR methylation/MSI) as inclusion criteria in a prospective clinical trial to optimize combinatorial strategies in the era of personalized medicine.},

   abstract = {Aberrant DNA methylation is commonly heralded as a promising cancer biomarker; however, its inherently stochastic nature often leads to variable methylation patterns that can complicate the use of methylation biomarkers for clinical diagnostics, particularly in dilute samples such as liquid biopsies. Here, we present a methylation density binary classifier, a statistical method for leveraging differential heterogeneous methylation to predict and optimize the performance of methylation biomarkers for clinical applications. We first developed and tested the classifier using methylation density profiles derived from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing reads of ovarian carcinoma at ZNF154, a recurrently methylated locus in multiple cancer types. We then used in silico simulations to predict the performance of the classifier in liquid biopsies and validated these predictions using quasi-digital melt curve analysis (DREAMing) of circulating cell-free DNA from individuals with versus without ovarian carcinoma. We found good agreement between predicted and observed classifier performance, and further demonstrated that implementation of this approach with ZNF154 outperformed CA-125 for use in etiologically-diverse ovarian cancer types. Our results indicate that methylation density profiles can be exploited to predict and facilitate implementation of methylation biomarkers for clinical applications, and that ZNF154 methylation shows promise as a clinically-useful biomarker for ovarian cancer.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The current paradigm in the development of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) proposes that the majority of HGSCs arise from precursor serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) lesions of the fallopian tube. Here we survey genome-wide methylation in HGSC precursor lesions to identify genomic regions that exhibit high-specificity differential hypermethylation for potential use as biomarkers for detecting STIC and HGSC at stages when curative intervention likely remains feasible.Experimental Design: We first identified quality control criteria for performing reliable methylomic analysis of DNA-limited tubal precursor lesions with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array. We then used this platform to compare genome-wide methylation among 12 STICs with paired adjacent-normal epithelia, one p53 signature lesion and two samples of concurrent HGSC. The resulting methylomic data were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and multidimensional analysis. Regions of high-confidence STIC-specific differential hypermethylation were identified using selective bioinformatic criteria and compared with published MethylationEPIC data from 23 HGSC tumors and 11 healthy fallopian tube mucosae.Results: Unsupervised analysis showed that STICs largely clustered with HGSCs, but were clearly distinct from adjacent-normal fallopian tube epithelia. Forty-two genomic regions exhibited high-confidence STIC-specific differential hypermethylation, of which 17 (40.5%) directly overlapped with HGSC-specific differentially methylated regions. Methylation at these shared loci was able to completely distinguish STIC and HGSC samples from normal and adjacent-normal specimens.Conclusions: Our results suggest that most STICs are epigenetically similar to HGSCs and share regions of differential hypermethylation that warrant further evaluation for potential use as biomarkers for early detection of ovarian HGSC.See related commentary by Ishak and De Carvalho, p. 6083},

   abstract = {A role for cancer cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer is well established. Here, we show that, in addition to cancer cell EMT, ovarian cancer cell metastasis relies on an epigenomic mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in host mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These reprogrammed MSCs, termed carcinoma-associated MSCs (CA-MSCs), acquire pro-tumorigenic functions and directly bind cancer cells to serve as a metastatic driver/chaperone. Cancer cells induce this epigenomic MET characterized by enhancer-enriched DNA hypermethylation, altered chromatin accessibility, and differential histone modifications. This phenomenon appears clinically relevant, as CA-MSC MET is highly correlated with patient survival. Mechanistically, mirroring MET observed in development, MET in CA-MSCs is mediated by WT1 and EZH2. Importantly, EZH2 inhibitors, which are clinically available, significantly inhibited CA-MSC-mediated metastasis in mouse models of ovarian cancer.},

   abstract = {There is growing evidence that most high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas likely arise from local dissemination of precursor lesions of the fallopian tube. Evolution of these lesions from early p53 signatures to latter-stage, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) is characterized by cytologic atypia, accumulation of somatic mutations, and genomic instability, the etiologies of which remain unclear. Long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1) retrotransposon is expressed in many carcinomas, including high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, where it contributes to genomic instability; however, the timing of LINE-1 activation during this evolution has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we assessed LINE-1 open reading frame 1 protein expression in 12 p53 signature lesions, 32 STICs, and 112 various types of ovarian cancers via immunohistochemical staining and examined LINE-1 promoter methylation in representative cases. We found that 78% and 57% of STICs, with and without concurrent ovarian carcinomas, respectively, exhibited intense LINE-1 immunoreactivity compared with adjacent, normal-appearing fallopian tube epithelium. Hypomethylation of the LINE-1 promoter was found in all STICs exhibiting overexpression. None of the 12 p53 signatures demonstrated significant LINE-1 expression. In ovarian cancer, 84 (75%) of 112 ovarian carcinomas overexpressed LINE-1. Our results indicate that LINE-1 retrotransposons often become deregulated during progression of ovarian cancer precursor lesions from the p53 signature to STIC stages and remain highly expressed in carcinoma.},

   abstract = {Purpose: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) typically remains undiagnosed until advanced stages when peritoneal dissemination has already occurred. Here, we sought to identify HGSOC-specific alterations in DNA methylation and assess their potential to provide sensitive and specific detection of HGSOC at its earliest stages.Experimental Design: MethylationEPIC genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on a discovery cohort comprising 23 HGSOC, 37 non-HGSOC malignant, and 36 histologically unremarkable gynecologic tissue samples. The resulting data were processed using selective bioinformatic criteria to identify regions of high-confidence HGSOC-specific differential methylation. Quantitative methylation-specific real-time PCR (qMSP) assays were then developed for 8 of the top-performing regions and analytically validated in a cohort of 90 tissue samples. Lastly, qMSP assays were used to assess and compare methylation in 30 laser-capture microdissected (LCM) fallopian tube epithelia samples obtained from cancer-free and serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) positive women.Results: Bioinformatic selection identified 91 regions of robust, HGSOC-specific hypermethylation, 23 of which exhibited an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) value ≥ 0.9 in the discovery cohort. Seven of 8 top-performing regions demonstrated AUC values between 0.838 and 0.968 when analytically validated by qMSP in a 90-patient cohort. A panel of the 3 top-performing genes (c17orf64, IRX2, and TUBB6) was able to perfectly discriminate HGSOC (AUC 1.0). Hypermethylation within these loci was found exclusively in LCM fallopian tube epithelia from women with STIC lesions, but not in cancer-free fallopian tubes.Conclusions: A panel of methylation biomarkers can be used to accurately identify HGSOC, even at precursor stages of the disease.},

   abstract = {BackgroundHypermethylation of promoter CpG islands [CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)] represents a unique pathway for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), characterized by lack of chromosomal instability and a low rate of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations, which have both been correlated with taxane resistance. Similarly, small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA), a rare tumor, also has a low rate of APC mutations. This phase II study evaluated taxane sensitivity in SBA and CIMP-high CRC.Patients and methodsThe primary objective was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 response rate. Eligibility included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1, refractory disease, and SBA or CIMP-high metastatic CRC. Nab-paclitaxel was initially administered at a dose of 260 mg/m2 every 3 weeks but was reduced to 220 mg/m2 owing to toxicity.ResultsA total of 21 patients with CIMP-high CRC and 13 with SBA were enrolled from November 2012 to October 2014. The efficacy-assessable population (patients who received at least three doses of the treatment) comprised 15 CIMP-high CRC patients and 10 SBA patients. Common grade 3 or 4 toxicities were fatigue (12%), neutropenia (9%), febrile neutropenia (9%), dehydration (6%), and thrombocytopenia (6%). No responses were seen in the CIMP-high CRC cohort and two partial responses were seen in the SBA cohort. Median progression-free survival was significantly greater in the SBA cohort than in the CIMP-high CRC cohort (3.2 months compared with 2.1 months, P = 0.03). Neither APC mutation status nor CHFR methylation status correlated with efficacy in the CIMP-high CRC cohort. In vivo testing of paclitaxel in an SBA patient-derived xenograft validated the activity of taxanes in this disease type.ConclusionAlthough preclinical studies suggested taxane sensitivity was associated with chromosomal stability and wild-type APC, we found that nab-paclitaxel was inactive in CIMP-high metastatic CRC. Nab-paclitaxel may represent a novel therapeutic option for SBA.},

   abstract = {This work presents a digital microfluidic platform called HYPER-Melt (high-density profiling and enumeration by melt) for highly parallelized copy-by-copy DNA molecular profiling. HYPER-Melt provides a facile means of detecting and assessing sequence variations of thousands of individual DNA molecules through digitization in a nanowell microchip array, allowing amplification and interrogation of individual template molecules by detecting HRM fluorescence changes due to sequence-dependent denaturation. As a model application, HYPER-Melt is used here for the detection and assessment of intermolecular heterogeneity of DNA methylation within the promoters of classical tumor suppressor genes. The capabilities of this platform are validated through serial dilutions of mixed epialleles, with demonstrated detection limits as low as 1 methylated variant in 2 million unmethylated templates (0.00005%) of a classic tumor suppressor gene, CDKN2A (p14ARF). The clinical potential of the platform is demonstrated using a digital assay for NDRG4, a tumor suppressor gene that is commonly methylated in colorectal cancer, in liquid biopsies of healthy and colorectal cancer patients. Overall, the platform provides the depth of information, simplicity of use, and single-molecule sensitivity necessary for rapid assessment of intermolecular variation contributing to genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity for challenging applications in embryogenesis, carcinogenesis, and rare biomarker detection.},

   abstract = {DNA methylation is a fundamental means of epigenetic gene regulation that occurs in virtually all cell types. In many higher organisms, including humans, it plays vital roles in cell differentiation and homeostatic maintenance of cell phenotype. The control of DNA methylation has traditionally been attributed to a highly coordinated, linear process, whose dysregulation has been associated with numerous pathologies including cancer, where it occurs early in, and even prior to, the development of neoplastic tissues. Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that, contrary to prevailing paradigms, methylation patterns are actually maintained through inexact, dynamic processes. These processes normally result in minor stochastic differences between cells that accumulate with age. However, various factors, including cancer itself, can lead to substantial differences in intercellular methylation patterns, viz. methylation heterogeneity. Advancements in molecular biology techniques are just now beginning to allow insight into how this heterogeneity contributes to clonal evolution and overall cancer heterogeneity. In the current review, we begin by presenting a didactic overview of how the basal bimodal methylome is established and maintained. We then provide a synopsis of some of the factors that lead to the accrual of heterogeneous methylation and how this heterogeneity may lead to gene silencing and impact the development of cancerous phenotypes. Lastly, we highlight currently available methylation assessment techniques and discuss their suitability to the study of heterogeneous methylation. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2017; April 1-5, 2017; Washington, DCBackground: Current approaches for the assessment of methylation, such as methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and next-generation bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) are fundamentally limited in their ability to detect and assess heterogeneous methylation patterns (epialleles) in ultra-rare (&lt;0.1%) DNA. These limitations critically compromise diagnostic utility and render them ill suited for many emerging applications in cancer diagnostics, such as the analysis of methylation heterogeneity in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and rare cell populations. We recently addressed the need for a low cost alternative to the assessment of methylation of ultra-rare DNA with the development of DREAMing (Discrimination of Rare EpiAlleles by Melt), which uses semi-limiting dilution and precise melt curve analysis to distinguish and enumerate individual copies of DNA at single copy sensitivity and single-CpG-site resolution. Here, we seek to demonstrate the advantages of the DREAMing method over conventional approaches to methylation assessment.Methods: We expand upon the underlying theory of DREAMing and provide guidelines for the development of single-copy sensitive DREAMing assays. We further elucidate methods for tailoring DREAMing assays to samples of interest and compare the performance of these assays to commonly employed techniques including quantitative MSP (qMSP) and BS-Seq.Results: Development of single-copy sensitive DREAMing assays for a number of loci associated with classic tumor-specific methylation such as CHFR and RASSF1A as well as a candidate pan-cancer locus are reported. These assays are then used to analyze methylation in cfDNA derived from the plasma of cancer-positive and healthy patients. DREAM analysis reveals that DREAMing can readily detect over an order of magnitude more epialleles when directly compared to qMSP and BS-Seq assays of the same locus. Some of the challenges associated with distinguishing potential tumor-specific aberrant methylation from background methylation are then discussed and proposed solutions are demonstrated. Lastly, methods for optimizing DREAMing assays for specific sample types are discussed.Conclusions: DREAMing is a recently introduced method for the assessment of locus-specific methylation in samples containing ultra rare target DNA. Its low cost and simplicity coupled with the ability to provide enhanced, single-copy detection of heterogeneous methylation make DREAMing an attractive option over traditional techniques for demanding specimens such as cfDNA and rare cell populations. DREAMing has potential utility in the evaluation of DNA methylation dynamics in cell populations, prenatal testing, as well as clear use in early cancer diagnostic, companion diagnostic and predictive applications.Citation Format: Thomas R.

The vast majority of techniques aimed at detecting methylation require bisulfite conversion of the DNA sample prior to analysis, which until now has been a benchtop process. Although microfluidics has potential benefits of simplified operation, sample and reagent economy, and scalability, bisulfite conversion has yet to be implemented in this format. Here, we present a novel droplet microfluidic design that facilitates rapid bisulfite conversion by reducing the necessary processing steps while retaining comparable performance to existing methods. This new format has a reduced overall processing time and is readily scalable for use in high throughput DNA methylation analysis.},

   abstract = {Many cancers comprise heterogeneous populations of cells at primary and metastatic sites throughout the body. The presence or emergence of distinct subclones with drug-resistant genetic and epigenetic phenotypes within these populations can greatly complicate therapeutic intervention. Liquid biopsies of peripheral blood from cancer patients have been suggested as an ideal means of sampling intratumor genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity for diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutic guidance. However, current molecular diagnostic and sequencing methods are not well suited to the routine assessment of epigenetic heterogeneity in difficult samples such as liquid biopsies that contain intrinsically low fractional concentrations of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and rare epigenetic subclonal populations. Here we report an alternative approach, deemed DREAMing (Discrimination of Rare EpiAlleles by Melt), which uses semi-limiting dilution and precise melt curve analysis to distinguish and enumerate individual copies of epiallelic species at single-CpG-site resolution in fractions as low as 0.005%, providing facile and inexpensive ultrasensitive assessment of locus-specific epigenetic heterogeneity directly from liquid biopsies. The technique is demonstrated here for the evaluation of epigenetic heterogeneity at p14ARF and BRCA1 gene-promoter loci in liquid biopsies obtained from patients in association with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), respectively.},

With the development of new techniques and tools to measure the genetic signature of tumors, biomarkers are increasingly being used to detect occult tumors, determine the choice of treatment and predict outcomes. Methylation of CpG islands at the promoter region of genes is a particularly exciting biomarker as it is cancer-specific. Older methods to detect methylation were cumbersome, operator-dependent and required large amounts of DNA. However, a newer technique called methylation on beads has resulted in a more uniform, streamlined and efficient assay. Furthermore, methylation on beads permits the extraction and processing of miniscule amounts of methylated tumor DNA in the peripheral blood.

SQUID magnetometry and histological iron stain were used for IONP tracking. Among the IONPs, DMSA-Fe2O3 NPs were potent pro-apoptotic agents in nerve, with differential ability to regulate oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic signaling in neuroglia, macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells.
