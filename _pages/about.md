Welcome to the official website of G.A.M.E.S. It is short for Graduate Association of Mechanical Engineering Students at McGill University. We represent all the masters, PhD and post doctoral students in the department at the university level. Games periodically hosts free social events at Thomson House (Martha Crago Lounge, main floor) for all of our wonderful GAMES members! Each member is welcome to enjoy some food and a beverage on behalf of GAMES. Come spend some time with your fellow Mechies. Join us on social media to stay updated.
