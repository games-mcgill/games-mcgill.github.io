Welcome to the official website of G.A.M.E.S. It is short for Graduate Association of Mechanical Engineering Students at McGill University. We represent all the masters, PhD and post doctoral students in the department at the university level. 

Our Mission:

- provide representation for the Membership, as appropriate;
- provide a sense of family to the graduate and postdoctoral researchers working within the Department;
- promote a sense of belonging among its members, so that they may easily seek assistance (academic or otherwise, as appropriate);
- arrange a healthy set of activities for its members, so that the participants may purposefully benefit from the athletic and recreational nature of an organized event; and,
- foster a sense of competition, academic, and otherwise, with equivalent organizations outside the Department.


Games periodically hosts free social events at MD267 and [Thomson House](http://thomsonhouse.ca/home) for all of our wonderful GAMES members! Each member is welcome to enjoy some food and a beverage on behalf of GAMES. Come spend some time with your fellow Mechies. Join us on social media to stay updated.
