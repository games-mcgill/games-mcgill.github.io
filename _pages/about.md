Welcome to to the website of Dr. Thomas Pisanic and the Epidiagnostics Group at Johns Hopkins University! I work with the <a href = "https://me.jhu.edu/thwang/">Wang laboratory</a> and an interdisciplinary <a href="/team/">team of JHU researchers</a> to gain deeper insight into the epigenetics of carcinogenesis and apply this knowledge toward the development of novel microfluidic molecular analysis platforms for cancer diagnostic applications. Our "epidiagnostics" team is comprised of faculty with a wide range of complementary expertise, including: <a href = "/members/Pisanic">Dr. Thomas Pisanic </a> (epigenetics, biomarker discovery and assay development), <a href = "https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/tza-huei-jeff-wang/"> Dr. Tza-Huei Wang </a>(bioengineering and microfluidic technologies), <a href ="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/hariharan-easwaran">Dr. Hari Easwaran </a> (genetics and epigenetics of cancer and aging) and <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/leslie-cope">Dr. Leslie Cope</a> (biostatistics and bioinformatics). Together, we work with numerous <a href ="/collaborators"> collaborators</a> from Johns Hopkins and beyond to apply our epigenetic methods to resolve manifold challenges in various areas of cancer research.
