Inspired by the works of [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), [Thomas R. Pisanic II, PhD](https://inbt.jhu.edu/epidiagnostics/) and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Developed by [siril-teja](https://github.com/siril-teja).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
