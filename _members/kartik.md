	Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering working with Prof. Jeffrey Bergthorson. My work focuses on quantifying NOx in metal combustion using laser diagnostics. This will enable to identify the pollutant that could potentially limit the use of metals as alternative fuels for clean energy. In free time, I enjoy long bike rides on weekend, hanging out with my friends and try cooking something new. I also like to play badminton, swim or go hiking to keep myself physically active.
