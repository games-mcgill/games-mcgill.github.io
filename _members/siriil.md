    I represent the graduate membership at the department level in their academic matters. I attend various departmental and Faculty meetings and get academic updates to you. Outside of GAMES, I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mbr/">MBR Lab</a> working on developing a biomechanical robotic spinal cord. In my free time, I enjoy cycling and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/siril.td/">photography</a>.
