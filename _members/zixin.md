     As VP Events, I am responsible for coming up with ways to effectively spend our association members’ money. This is aided by my research: the analysis of commodity price patterns with CamelCamelCamel, RedFlagDeals, StockTrack, and Facebook Marketplace. On the side, I also investigate methods for delaying VP Finance’s graduation.
