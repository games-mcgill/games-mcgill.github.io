	Hi, I represent the graduate membership at the department level in their academic matters. I attend various departmental and Faculty meetings and get academic updates to you. Outside of GAMES, I am a PhD student working on developing a biomechanical robotic spinal cord. My research involves study of human spine under different physiological loading conditions. I love cycling and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/siril.td/).
